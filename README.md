# Mysql Generated Models
A SQL first orm that emphesises simplicity and testing.  
Instead of managing the database MysqlGM attempts to examine the database and create base models to use with 
your existing data. Instead of writing how these objects are going to talk to eachother a user gives the model MYSQL data.
